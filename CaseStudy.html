<h3>
  Is Capitalism running rampant through your'e community? Are food prices skyrocketing and doesn't look as if they are gonna stop? Well do I have a solution for you!
</h3>
    <section>
      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that 4 billion tons of food is produced per year and 1.3 billion tons of it goes to waste, while
        there are almost 1 billion people who go to bed hungry and about 350 million who are mal-nourished. Sad to think
        about really. The root cause of it is Capitalism. If money isn't being made, another route is taken. And
        that is why so many different communities are suffering from these food systems. A profit always need to be
        made. That's why there is so much inflation and food that was once cost-effective and accessible is now
        becoming less cost-effective and still accessible. But no-one is able to buy them. And as a result
        profit margins decrease which then leads to price increase or inflation. And so with this I am creating my own
        hydroponic system of growing plants without soil and hoping to help people to be inspired to do the same thing
        and help with the economic unstability and also the severe lack of food distribution that plagues our country. We have a variety of
        different plants that we can grow such as tomatoes, cilantro, lettuce, kale. And even plants that aren't native
        to the region you may be in as well. And this is all to help better our food systems that are in place and to
        help raise awareness of the Capitalism problem we have running rampant through our country.

      <h2> Background </h2>
      <p>
    A little background knowledge for you. I was originally like any other boy in the world. Spending too much time on my Xbox, going outside but not taking advantage of the greenery around me until I met my WBL(Work Based Learning) teacher Mrs.Ferguson. She encoruaged me to take up this course. And as a result my eyes were opened and I was enlightened to the problem in today's world. I want to break the generational curse today of being ignorant. Not by choice but the design of the world today. And to do that I will be growing Habanero Peppers in my own home. And when I am done and cultivated my fruitage I will attempt to make my own hot pepper sauce because there is this scotch bonnet sauce my mom uses when cooking and I thought it would be a cool project. I do plan on growing more variety of things such as Kale, Lettuce, Tomatoes and other plants. And I encourage all to do this because in the long not only are you saving money but you are also enjoying the privledge of eating fresh produce grown in your'e very own home. </p>

      <h2> Project Overview </h2>
      
      <p> Now of course I can't just click my heels and make a hydroponic system magically appear like Dorothy. It takes time and planning and a whole lot of research. </p>
      
      <p> Full Project Plan Available: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11krPelWYWDrYRoEhPrd8QQYQYV3bZ8Qfix3lhSd67j0/edit?pli=1">Click Me</a></p>

      <h2> Budget </h2>
      <p>
        The budget was an intial $500. This was to buy all the materials nessecary to build my system. After the completion of the build and start of  With an additional $250 to maintian my system after I have built it and made progress.

      <h2> Timeline </h2>
      <p>
    <p> Natural growth time for Habanero Peppers is usually 60-90 days. It can go up to 110 days if you include the germination process. </p>

<p> With the continuation of this project I will soon be adding 2 holes into the yellow lid and adding 2 of my habanero seeds utilizing 4 inch net cups and rockwell. I will be naming one of the seeds I Am Groot and the other will be named Yggdrasill. </p>
