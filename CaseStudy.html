      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that 4 billion tons of food is produced per year and 1.3 billion tons of it goes to waste, while
        there are almost 1 bliion people who go to bed hungry and about 350 million who are mal-nourished. Sad to think
        about really. And the root cause of it is Capitalism. if money isn't being made, another route is taken. And
        that is why so many different communities are suffering from these food systems. A profit always need to be
        made. And that's why there is so much inflation and food that was once cost-effective and accessible is now
        becoming less cost-effective and still accessible. But no-one is able to buy them. And as a result
        profit-margins decrease which then leads to price increase or inflation. And so with this I am creating my own
        hydroponic system of growing plants without soil and hoping to help people to be inspired to do the same thing
        and help with the economic unstability and also food distribution that plagues our country. We have a vaiety of
        different plants that we can grow such as tomatoes, cilantro, lettuce, kale. And even plants that aren't native
        to the region you may be in as well. And this is all to help better our food systems that are in place and to
        help raise awareness of the Capitalism problem we have running rampart through our country.

      <h2> About your Home Farm System </h2>
      <p>
        I will be utlizing the Kraty System and The Flood and Drain System for my Home Farm System. By incorporating
        both systems it will allow me to analyze and compare which system is best for growing the type of plants I want.
